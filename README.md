# Clima2022
This folder contains the generated and analysed datasets for "Clima 2022: the 14th REHVA HVAC World Congress" in Rotterdam (The Netherlands).
Two folders are used to separate experimental and simulation results.
Each folder contains a README with a short clarification of the different result files in the related folder and also an explanation of the used acronyms for the results and their related units.

Both the experimental and simulation results are provided and use a 15 seconds time step.
For the simulation results, additional data points are also saved at occuring events (e.g. change of a binary control variable) between regular saving time intervals. 

Submitted paper:  Evens M, Arteconi A. Hardware-in-the-loop heat pump model validation for flexibility evaluations. In: Proceedings of Clima 2022: the 14th REHVA HVAC World Congress. 2022.
